# DHBW Mannheim Semiconductors
This is a repository of ICs which are obsolete but useful for laboratory
exercises. They are either ROMs (e.g., 27C32 or 27C64) or Microcontrollers
(e.g., ATtiny26) which fulfill a specific purpose such as one that is similar
to ICs like the 74185 (which is pretty obsolete by now).

## ICs

| Designation | Purpose                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| DHM185      | Similar but incompatible 74185, emulated by 27C16 or 27C32     |
| DHM185X     | Similar but incompatible 74185, emulated by Attiny26           |
| DHM252-11   | Two SA52-11 common anode 7-segment displays in a DIP20 package |
